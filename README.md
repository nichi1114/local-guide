## Motivation
With the rise of the internet and social media, people increasingly enjoy taking photos at popular, internet-famous locations. However, most current apps prioritize broad, global recommendations over personalized local exploration. This highlights the need for a lightweight mobile tool that enables users to record, revisit, and organize their own local discoveries in a single, convenient platform. Our app addresses this need by offering a straightforward and user-friendly platform for organizing local points of interest. The target users are local adventurers who enjoy exploring their city, trying new cafes, parks, or attractions, and want an easy way to record and remember those discoveries.

## Objectives
The project aims to create a Local Guide app for local adventurers, allowing them to add, view, and organize their local points of interest in a safe, simple, and intuitive way.

## Technical Stack
The application utilized **React Native** with **Expo** as its development framework, implemented in **TypeScript**. State management is handled by the **Redux Toolkit**, and data is persisted locally using **React Native Async Storage** to retain state across app restarts.
